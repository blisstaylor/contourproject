            <h4>Contour 556 is Canberra’s biennial public art festival, curated by Neil Hobbs.</h4>
            <p>Contour 556 is the water level of Lake Burley Griffin, which links the event in name as well as in
                purpose to the history of the central Canberra landscape. The artworks and installations selected for
                the festival respond in some way to Canberra’s history, from 50,000 years to the present day. contour
                556 will therefore offer the Canberra, Australian and international community a unique opportunity to
                engage with and understand the layers of Canberra’s history through art.</p>
