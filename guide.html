                <h4>The 2022 edition sees the festival rebranded as Canberra Art Biennial, and sees expansion to the
                    National Arboretum (contour 656), the University of Canberra (contour 606) as well as maintaining
                    and building further on our presence in North and South Canberra, centred on contour 556, the height
                    above sea level of Lake Burley Griffin.</h4>

                <h4>Canberra Art Biennial extends across Canberra’s public spaces, and we are excited to partner with
                    more private and public gallery / cultural spaces in inner north and south Canberra.</h4>

                <p>Neil Hobbs is the creative director for the contour 556 and contour 656 areas, with support from
                    Heeseon Jung and the contour 556 board. The contour 606 satellite event will be co-curated by
                    University of Canberra staff members Associate Professor Julian Raxworthy, discipline lead of the
                    landscape architecture program and Ben Ennis-Butler, senior lecturer and Program Core Coordinator,
                    Design.</p>

                <p>University of Canberra joins us as a major sponsor and supporter - The Faculty of Arts and Design
                    students have revisited our logo and graphic branding, and we are delighted to have Julian and Ben
                    contribute to the event.</p>


                <p>Artists will be responding to the designed city of Canberra: represented by Australia’s political,
                    cultural and physical history. The event engages people of all ages and abilities, delighting,
                    puzzling and encouraging interaction with art and public space.</p>

                <p>The 2022 event is supported by sponsorship from the University of Canberra, Bonhams, KDN Group, Keir
                    Foundation, numerous individual supporters through our crowdfunding pitches and the ACT Government.
