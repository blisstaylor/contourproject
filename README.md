## Reflection
### Bliss Taylor


My main goal for the contour 556 site was to highlight the art. I have attempted to do this by including whole-page hero images of past artworks, while keeping the colours of the functions of the site fairly monochromatic. This allows the images to stand out and not clash. The background of the main site is slightly off white, with the text being a very dark grey, making the site easier on the eye, rather than extremely contrasting.

I removed and compiled pages from the original contour 556 site to create 6 sections for my site. These are **home**, **guide**, **gallery**, **news**, **donate** and **about**. 

The **home** page is an overview of the site, with links to the other 5 sections. The guide is a page where information about the upcoming festival is located. Anything to do with locations, times and other events would be able to be added here when the information is available. I have currently inputted all of the information on the website about the 2022 edition of the festival.

The **gallery** holds all information about each year’s festival, with examples of each artwork shown in a dynamic grid. Different artworks take up more space depending on the size of the browser. I have used hover effects on this page to present the artists’ names over the images. I removed this feature for tablet and mobile viewing, instead always showing the artists’ names with a slightly dark background to keep the text readable. 

The **news** page uses a simple grid, with the idea being that news around the fesitval and other updates can be worked into this section. This page is designed to be regularly updated.

The **donate** page has been combined with the supporters page. I have used a secondary image here behind the donate form (also seen on the contact and guide pages) to liven the page up, also bringing the focus back to the art. The information about the festival as well as the team details have been compiled into my **about** page, making it easier for a viewer to understand the background of the festival and the people involved without having to navigate through multiple pages.

For the purposes of this assignment I have limited the examples of artists in the gallery page to 6. This number was enough to show the design and how the site works responsively. Any more pages than this would simply add to the size of the site rather than showing any other ideas. For these same reasons I have also limited the news articles to 3 working links. Yet I have used 6 thumbnails on the main news page to properly show what the page would realistically look like with more articles.

I have organised my css file into sections. General styles and other global styles are at the top of the file before it is separated into pages. Media queries are at the bottom. I have used different grids to lay out my content, always using a 12 column base. By doing this I have attempted to keep the website consistent while also making each page slightly different.

My original vision for this site has certainly been realised, but I also believe I have taken the site to a higher level than I thought I might be able to. My early prototypes do resemble what I have made, as seen here:

You can see here that this does look somewhat like the home page, however, where exactly things are on the website is different. This is due to me wanting the order to reflect the hierarchy seen in the menu.

Once I was working digitally I was able to see how the scale would work etc which made much more sense in my head. This design stayed and that is pretty much how the top of the home page looks now.

This sketch is a prototype of the what I thought the artist pages might look like. I did not use sticky images for these pages because I wanted to differentiate these pages to the rest of the site. The images on the artist pages are key parts of the content – not decoration images like I have used on other pages on the site.

This is the digital prototype of the artist page which you can see looks almost identical to how they look on the site. I changed a few things from the sketch once I understood more about how I would actually code the website.

This is an early screenshot from when I first was making the site. I obviously did not understand how a grid worked at this stage.

![Digital prototype of gallery page](/reflection/prototype-gallery.png)

I really liked the idea of using a tile grid for the gallery page. I did end up making this but I am glad that I was able to go further and make it a little bit more interesting than this. And by that I mean having different sized images and really using the grid for what it can do.

It is important to look back at screenshots like this one. This is the early stages of the gallery page. At this point I was not sure I would be able to submit anything! I had no idea how to properly use a grid or flex and nothing was working the way I wanted it to. I think it is important to reflect on this because it is a great reminder of how far I have come in roughly a month.

I dedicated lots of time to this assignment and really focused on fixing my issues in the best way I could. There were also a few "Ben problems" (ones I couldn't find the answers to) – but it was great to learn from those too.

I feel like it clicked at just the right moment and I am proud of what I have been able to achieve. However, I think if I were to make this site again, I would like to think my css would be tidier and shorter. I think there are definitely more efficient ways to do what I did – and if there aren't, there probably should be :)

## Resources:

https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/
This was a fantastic resource! After reading this I was able to understand much more about grid systems and I was able to implement much of these learnings to my site.

https://alvarotrigo.com/blog/hamburger-menu-css-responsive/
I used this tutorial to make a hamburger menu for my site. I did still have a few issues with this after the tutorial but thankfully Ben was able to help out.

Then I last minute decided to animate the hamburger. I used this tutorial (thanks for the link Ben). I customised the hamburger by changing the size and colour.

Most of the other resources I used were quick google searches and asking Ben/Riley questions in both of my classes. I have found doing 2 web design courses at the same time to help me a lot because I have been dedicating a lot of time to coding in general.
