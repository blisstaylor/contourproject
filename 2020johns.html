                <p class="sub-heading">About the work</p>
                <p>Hovering Figure is a Corten steel sculpture which was inspired by the extraordinary Wedge Tail eagles
                    which hover over the rock escarpment on my property at Palmer in South Australia. At this site a
                    smaller version sits/floats on the edge of the actual rock escarpment, suspended between two large
                    rocks. The larger version I will show in Canberra is 756 cm wide x 582 cm long. It can sit/hover at
                    various heights above the ground, suspended by rocks at 3 points. The site will determine the
                    height. There is also a textured pattern that runs across its entire surface reflective of the
                    Australian landscape as seen from above. At the Contour 556 exhibition it should float both subtly
                    and dramatically in the large open space there, mimicking the wedge tail eagles which glide across
                    our broad blue skies, floating above our profoundly ancient and unique landscape.</p>

                <p class="sub-heading">About the artist</p>
