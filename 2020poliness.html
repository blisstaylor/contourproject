                <p class="sub-heading">About the work</p>
                <p>The artist will lead the production of large-scale ‘walking drawings’ on the paved ground surfaces at
                    two sites. The public is invited to participate in making a large circular drawing in front of the
                    National Library and long ‘wave’ drawings along University Avenue. No previous experience or
                    artistic skills are required. The drawing process is open to all ages, wheelchair users are also
                    welcome. The drawings are made using ‘jumbo’ chalk which is applied while walking and using
                    specially designed drawing sticks designed and supplied by the artist. The pace of walking and
                    drawing is self-directed. The lines of the drawing become pathways to follow which become more
                    clearly defined as repeated layers of chalk are applied through drawing while walking. There is no
                    limit to the number of people who can participate, however the scale of the drawing and physical
                    distancing will limit the number of people who can be present on the drawing at one time, courteous
                    behaviour and giving way to others is also required in order to keep the drawing in process.</p>

                <p class="sub-heading">About the artist</p>
                <p>Kerrie Poliness combines everyday materials, geometric abstraction and DIY culture to develop
                    paintings, sculptures, drawings, exhibitions, videos and instruction books which are used to make
                    large-scale site responsive drawings onto wall and ground surfaces. In 1988 Poliness restricted her
                    practice to focus on permutations of the diamond shape and associated intersecting diagonal lines.
                    Poliness’s artworks explore interdependencies between people, objects, architectural space, nature
                    and art. Appearing as wonky grid-like patterns, her instruction-based drawings visualise and
                    demonstrate how asymmetry and diversity arise through the repeated application of systems to matter.
                    They also demonstrate how to make and practice steering ‘adaptive grids’. Fast algorithms paired
                    with meshes (grids) are increasingly used to compute and collect data to design and plan our world.
                    Adaptive meshes help refine our interrelationships with the natural world. These drawing instruction
                    books are slow algorithms which can be used to explore and visualise the nature of these processes.
                </p>
                <p>Kerrie Poliness has exhibited extensively since 1987, her artworks are represented in public and
                    private collections throughout Australia. She co-founded the artist initiatives Store 5 gallery
                    (1989-91) with Gary Wilson and Melinda Harper and Circular magazine (1993 – 2000) with Marco
                    Fusinato. Poliness has carried out various architectural, cultural, heritage and environmental
                    projects in collaboration with a wide range of groups and individuals, particularly Melbourne’s
                    Living Museum of the West (1994 - 2019) where she co-manages the arts programs. Poliness currently
                    has a PhD under examination (2020), is a board member of West Space (2015-20) and is represented by
                    Anna Schwartz Gallery.</p>
