                <p class="sub-heading">About the work</p>
                <p>Shroud is an ephemeral spatial drawing that educes what Ben Anderson terms ‘the affective atmosphere’
                    of life after periods of crisis. It responds to the red summer with which the year 2020 began, the
                    subsequent health and economic crisis, and the fissures they have riven in our collective mood. This
                    year has brought the realisation that the slow unravelling of our ecology has gained irreversible
                    momentum. At the same time, the viral outbreak has compelled us to face with sober senses the
                    fragility of our once taken for granted ways of living. After a year of grief and fear, this artwork
                    asks its audience to take time to pause. To listen and hold close our ardent longing for the futures
                    we once possessed but that dissolved into smoke, and to find the fortitude to care for each other
                    through the uncertain future. </p>

                <p class="sub-heading">About the artist</p>
                <p>Hannah Quinlivan is a young artist who has found her own distinctive voice, one which unites the
                    intimate and the personal with the public and universal. Her art is distinctive, intense and very
                    memorable. Sasha Grishin, 2018. Hannah Quinlivan’s abstract drawing practice has a number of
                    strands, with ephemeral site-specific spatial drawing becoming increasingly important to her work.
                    She completed a major public art commission for the Canberra Light Rail Network in 2019, creating
                    drawings that were integrated into each of the thirteen stops on the new line. Over the last five
                    years, she has exhibited site specific ephemeral artworks in Berlin, Paris, New York, Cambridge,
                    Colorado, Italy, Hong Kong, Sydney and Melbourne. Quinlivan is represented in number of collections
                    including the National Gallery of Australia.</p>
